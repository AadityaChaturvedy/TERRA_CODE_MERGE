# TERRA

TERRA is an **IoT-based smart agri project** designed to automate irrigation, nutrient delivery, and climate monitoring for efficient and sustainable agriculture.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of key environmental parameters (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light, UV, NPK)
- Automated irrigation and nutrient control system
- Remote access and manual override via web dashboard
- Modular software and hardware design

## Project Structure

- `/hardware/` — Schematics, Arduino and ESP32 code
- `/software/` — Backend (web server), dashboard frontend, data parsing scripts
- `/docs/` — Reports, documentation, and supporting material

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AadityaChaturvedy/TERRA_CODE_MERGE.git

## Requirements

- Arduino UNO, ESP32 module, sensors (Soil moisture, AHT-10, BH1750, GUVA UV)
- Python 3.8+ or Node.js (for backend/frontend)
- PlatformIO or Arduino IDE (for microcontroller code)

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! For major changes, open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
