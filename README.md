## TERRA: IoT-Based Smart Agriculture System ðŸŒ±

TERRA is an IoT-based smart agriculture project designed to automate and optimize farming practices. By integrating real-time ground sensor data with large-scale satellite imagery, TERRA delivers actionable insights for efficient and sustainable agriculture.

## Features

Hybrid Data Monitoring: Combines hyper-local data from on-ground sensors with large-scale satellite imagery to provide a complete and accurate picture of your farm's health.

Real-Time Ground Truth: Get live updates on critical soil and atmospheric conditions, including soil moisture, NPK levels, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and UV index.

Satellite-Powered Insights: Leverage satellite data to monitor vegetation health (NDVI, NDWI, EVI) across your entire field and receive predictive alerts for potential pest outbreaks.

Remote Access & Control: Monitor your farm's conditions and manually override automated systems from anywhere in the world using a responsive web dashboard on your phone or laptop.

Customized Crop Reporting: Select your crop type and generate detailed, actionable reports that fuse both ground and satellite data for tailored recommendations.

Historical Trend Analysis: View and analyze historical data through interactive charts to identify patterns, track crop performance, and optimize your farming strategies for future seasons.

Scalable & Modular Design: The system is built to grow with your farm. Easily expand your network from a single module to cover entire fields with our modular hardware and software architecture.
